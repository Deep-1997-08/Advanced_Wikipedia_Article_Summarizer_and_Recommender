# InfoSeeker: Advanced Wikipedia Article Summarizer and Recommender

InfoSeeker is a cutting-edge platform designed to transform the way information is accessed and consumed from Wikipedia. By leveraging sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning technologies, InfoSeeker provides users with succinct summaries and tailored recommendations of Wikipedia articles, facilitating a more efficient and personalized learning experience.

## Project Overview

InfoSeeker embodies the pinnacle of efforts to democratize information by making it more digestible and relevant to individual users. This project bridges the gap between the vast expanse of knowledge available on Wikipedia and the specific needs and interests of users, ensuring that they can access the information they need quickly and easily.

### Data Mining and Processing Excellence

The project has successfully harnessed Wikipedia's Vital Level 4 dataset, containing over 10,000 articles that span essential domains of knowledge. Through the application of BeautifulSoup4, the project curated a high-quality, relevant dataset that serves as the foundation for all of InfoSeeker's operations, ensuring accuracy and reliability in the information provided.

### Innovations in Summarization Techniques

InfoSeeker incorporates a hybrid approach to summarization, combining extractive and abstractive methods. By integrating LDA, NMF, and BART models, the project generates summaries that are not only precise but also maintain the natural flow of language, significantly enhancing user comprehension and engagement.

### Personalized Recommendation System

At its core, InfoSeeker features an advanced recommendation engine developed to suggest articles based on user preferences and interaction history. This bespoke approach to content discovery empowers users to explore Wikipedia in a more meaningful and directed manner, enriching their overall learning experience.

### Advancements in Named Entity Recognition and Classification

The project has made significant strides in improving text analysis capabilities through the implementation of Named Entity Recognition (NER) and multi-class text classification. These technologies have elevated the precision of summaries and the relevance of recommendations, with the classification model achieving remarkable accuracy rates.
